./components/ui/ItemOptionsModal.tsx:418:36
Type error: Conversion of type '{ ref: string; title: string; extra: number; quantity: number; price: { unit_price: { amount: number; currency_code: string; formatted_amount: string; }; total_price: { amount: number; currency_code: string; formatted_amount: string; }; }; }' to type 'MenuItem' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
